# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling. The `bug.js` file shows a route handler that lacks proper error handling, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a route handler that fetches a user from a database.  It fails to handle errors appropriately: 

1. **Database Query Failure:** If the database query fails, the error is not caught, leading to a potential crash or unexpected behavior.
2. **User Not Found:** If the user with the given ID does not exist, no appropriate response is returned to the client.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected version of the route handler. It includes error handling for both database query failures and cases where the user is not found.  Appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages are returned to the client in these scenarios.
